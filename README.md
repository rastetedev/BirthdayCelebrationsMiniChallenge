# 👩🏻‍💻📓✍🏻💡 Challenge Set - Jun 2025 - Birthday Celebrations

Part of the **Mobile Dev Campus Main App Challenge** by [Philipp Lackner](https://pl-coding.com/campus)

## Mini challenge 1 : [Easy] - Birthday Invitation Card
### 🎭 Scenario
You’re onboarding a new dev who swears by XML. To show them the glory of Jetpack Compose, you promise to recreate a simple birthday invite screen "without even opening a layout file." Now the pressure’s on — you need a clean layout that looks great.
### 🎯 Feature Goal
Build a static birthday invite screen using only Jetpack Compose layout elements.

## Mini challenge 2 : [Easy] - Cake Lighting Controller
### 🎭 Scenario
You’re building a prototype for a smart birthday cake. Yes, really. The client insists it’s the future: a cake where each candle is toggled digitally — no fire hazards, no spit. Your job? The UI. Each candle has to be individually switchable, and the app should show how many are currently "lit." It’s absurd, it’s oddly fun, and it’s your challenge now.
### 🎯 Feature Goal
Create a candle panel where toggled-off candles automatically relight themselves after a short delay.

## Mini challenge 3 : [Easy] - Countdown to cake
### 🎭 Scenario
You’re building a birthday countdown app for a very punctual party planner. They want users to press a button, wait a few suspenseful seconds, and then get a celebratory notification that it’s cake time. Oh — and of course, users should be able to cancel the countdown. Because sometimes, the cake isn’t ready yet.
### 🎯 Feature Goal
Let users start a countdown that triggers a birthday notification after a few seconds — unless they cancel it first.

## Mini challenge 4 : [Medium] - Party Host Dashboard
### 🎭 Scenario
You’re building a party planning dashboard, and the client is very picky about how it looks on different devices. On phones, they want it clean and focused. On tablets? “I want to see everything at once!” they say, gesturing wildly. You sigh, open Compose, and get to work making a UI that shape-shifts like a social butterfly — drawer on phones, two-pane layout on tablets.
### 🎯 Feature Goal
Create a responsive party host dashboard that shows different layouts on phone vs. tablet screens.

## 🧠 What I put in practice

- Layouts with Jetpack Compose **adaptive layouts**, **animations**, **constraint layout in compose**, **edge-to-edge UI**.
- **Adaptive navigation** with NavigationSuiteScaffold, NavigableListDetailPaneScaffold and Custom Nav Types
- Show **system notifications**
- Handle side effects using **LaunchedEffect**
